 Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to get her play funded through a kickstarter campaign.   
### Purpose
Using a dataset on entertainment to help with launching a Kickstarter campaign we find the best ways to fund a play as well as the best time of year to launch a campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
My greatest challenges were figuring out how to write the functions correctly in order to gather the correct information.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
I can conclude that best months to launch a kickstarter campaign are between April and May since those are the months where outcome is the highest.I can aslo conclude that failed capmaign outcomes stayed consistent between 40 and 60 outcomes.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- I can conclude that the most successfull kickstarters range between less than $1,000 and $1,000 to $4,999. I can also conclude that failed campaigns usually range between $20,000 to $24,999 and $45,000 to $49,999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- The dataset has too many items that are not relevant to theatres or plays. The dataset also could have used more items relevant to plays to make the outcomes more effective. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a bar graph, picto graph or a box and whiskers graph to find trends in successful,failed or cancelled campaigns. Some trends could be outliers or the months of failed or successful campaigns and their amounts.
