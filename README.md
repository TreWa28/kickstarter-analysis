 Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise, a playwrite, wants to get her play funded through a kickstarter campaign.   
### Purpose
Using a dataset based on entertainment to help us with launching a Kickstarter campaign, we find the best ways to fund a play based on donors and amount as well as the best time of year to launch a campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For the analysis of outcomes based on launch date I created a pivot table with parent category and years in filters,date created conversion in rows, outcomes in columns, and count of outcomes in values. This pivot table details the number of theatre campaigns that were successful, failed, or canceled based on their laucnh dates in months between January and December. The line graph below deatils the results of my pivot table.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For the analysis of outcomes based on goals I created a chart that shows the amount of kickstarter goals for plays here in the US from less than $1,000 to $50,000 or more. The chart shows the total numbers and percentages of goals that were either successful, failed or canceled. The line graph below details those percentages.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
My greatest challenges were figuring out how to write the functions correctly. I needed the correct functions in order to gather the correct information to create columns and rows in the Outcomes Based on Goals worksheet. Also the filtering on the graph to create the corrrect image was difficult.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
I can conclude that best months to launch a kickstarter campaign are between April and May since those are the months where outcome is the highest.I can aslo conclude that failed capmaign outcomes stayed consistent between 40 and 60. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- I can conclude that the most successfull kickstarters range between less than $1,000 and $1,000 to $4,999. I can also conclude that failed campaigns usually range between $20,000 to $24,999 and $45,000 to $49,999. The number od canceled campaigns stayed consistant with 0 for all categories.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset has too many items that are not relevant to theatres or plays. The dataset also could have used more items relevant to plays to make the outcomes more effective. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a bar graph, picto graph or a box and whiskers graph to find trends in successful,failed or cancelled campaigns. Some trends could be outliers or the months of failed or successful campaigns and their amounts.
